# Javascript Challenge

Included in this repository is a blank HTML template containing the list of items stored in the *info* variable. This is a sample data that you might get when you are requesting data from a REST API endpoint.

Using the provided HTML file, please create a mobile web prototype following the wireframe (wireframe.png). 

### Regarding the Wireframe:
Please note that this is just a "wireframe" and we would expect you to apply some usable designs. 
You are free to create your own design or apply existing design/frameworks (Bootstrap, Foundation, and Material UI)

## Requirements:
* HTML5 and CSS3 required.
* Items should be dynamically added when the page loads.
* Please use Javascript only. We can reconsider jQuery... no other frameworks (ReactJS, AngularJS, Vue.js, etc...)

## Please answer the following questions:
* Please explain how did you come up with the solution. We would like to see your train of thought.
* Please explain any design decisions made (why you chose the design/framework, etc.)
* Please indicate tools that you used for coming up with your solution.
* Choose one: Star Wars or Star Trek? Why?
